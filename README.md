# ANT_to_Xbee_with_arduino
Interfacing an ANT+ Garmin Tempe with an Xbee using an Arduino to pull temperature data

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT

For the little anecdote, I have a few Arduino boards lying around from a previous project picking up some dust and I was wondering what I could do with them and a specially with the two Digi Xbee series 1 including their Arduino shields. So ideas started working in the back of my head without anything clear.
We went trekking a few weeks ago and I found in the bottom of my backpack an old Garmin Tempe I used to pair with my Garmin Fenix 1 and Fenix 3. The idea popped;
why not use my Garmin Tempe as an extra temperature sensor for my Adruino homemade Weatherstation.

This Git repo, provides at this stage hints and information on how to interface these modules and devices together. Currently the streams investigated are;

-	ANT and ANT+ protocols
-	Digi XBee® series 1 (802.15.4)
-	Digi XBee® XCTU
-	Arduino
